# Kubeconfig Directory

This directory contains the Kubernetes configuration files (credentials) for accessing the cluster.

**These files are generated automatically and should NOT be committed to version control.**

## Expected Files

After running `infra/scripts/setup.sh`, this directory should contain:

*   **`admin.yaml`**: The cluster administrator credentials (generated by `kubeadm`).
    *   Used by the `infra/admin` Pulumi stack.
    *   Used for troubleshooting and initial setup.

After following the "Bootstrap Restricted User" steps in the main README, this directory should also contain:

*   **`nginx-deployer.yaml`**: The restricted user credentials.
    *   Used by the `apps/nginx` Pulumi stack.
    *   Has limited permissions (scoped to `app-nginx` namespace).
